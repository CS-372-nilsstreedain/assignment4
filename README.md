# Assignment 4
1. Consider a broadcast channel with N nodes and a transmission rate of R bps. Suppose the broadcast channel uses polling (with an additional polling node) for multiple access. Suppose the amount of time from when a node completes transmission until the subsequent node is permitted to transmit (that is, the polling delay) is ùëëpoll. Suppose that within a polling round, a given node is allowed to transmit at most Q bits. What is the maximum throughput of the broadcast channel?
```
Polling round = N((Q / R) + dpoll)
Max throughput = (NQ) / (N((Q / R) + dpoll))
= Q / ((Q / R) + dpoll)
= Q / ((Q / R) + (Rdpoll / R))
= Q / ((Q + Rdpoll) / R)
= QR / (Q + Rdpoll)
```

2. Consider three LANs interconnected by two routers, as shown in Figure 1.
  - Assign IP addresses to all of the interfaces. For Subnet 1 use addresses of the form 192.168.1.xxx; for Subnet 2 uses addresses of the form 192.168.2.xxx; and for Subnet 3 use addresses of the form 192.168.3.xxx.
```
Router 1-1: 192.168.1.1
A: 192.168.1.3
B: 192.168.1.4

Router 2-1: 192.168.3.1
E: 192.168.3.3
F: 192.168.3.4

Router 1-2: 192.168.2.1
Router 2-2: 192.168.2.2
C: 192.168.2.3
D: 192.168.2.4
```

  - Assign MAC addresses to all of the adapters.
```
Router 1-1: 00:00:00:00:00:00
A: 00:00:00:00:00:05
B: 00:00:00:00:00:06

Router 2-1: 00:00:00:00:00:03
E: 00:00:00:00:00:09
F: 00:00:00:00:00:0A

Router 1-2: 00:00:00:00:00:02
Router 2-2: 00:00:00:00:00:04
C: 00:00:00:00:00:07
D: 00:00:00:00:00:08
```
  - Consider sending an IP datagram from Host E to Host B. Suppose all of the ARP tables are up to date. Enumerate all the steps.
```
1. According to the forwarding table for host E, the IP datagram must be routed from 192.168.3.3 to 192.168.3.1
2. The interface for host E creates and sends an ethernet frame with a source of 00:00:00:00:00:09 and a destination of 00:00:00:00:00:03.
3. The Router 2-1 interface receives the frame and it is unpacked into a datagram.
4. According to the forwarding table for router 2, the datagram must be routed from 192.168.2.2 to 192.168.2.1
5. The Router 2-2 interface creates and sends an ethernet frame with a source of 00:00:00:00:00:04 and a destination of 00:00:00:00:00:02.
6. The Router 1-2 interface receives the frame and it is unpacked into a datagram.
7. According to the forwarding table for router 1, the datagram must be routed from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.3
8. The Router 1-1 interface creates and sends an ethernet frame with a source of 00:00:00:00:00:00 and a destination of 00:00:00:00:00:06.
9. The Router 1-2 interface receives the frame and it is unpacked into a datagram.
```

  - Repeat (c), now assuming that the ARP table in the sending host is empty (and the other tables are up to date).
```
1. Host E broadcast a newly generated ARP frame, requesting the destination address of B.
2. Interface Router 2-1 receives the frame and has the corresponding destination address so a reply frame is generated.
3. Interface Router 2-1 responds back, using a destination address of host E.
4. Host E receives the reply frame and updates the ARP cache with the newly received information.
```

3. Consider the figure in Problem 4 above. Provide MAC addresses and IP addresses for the interfaces at Host A, both routers, and Host F. Suppose Host A sends a datagram to Host F. Give the source and destination MAC addresses in the frame encapsulating this IP datagram as the frame is transmitted (i) from A to the left router, (ii) from the left router to the right router, (iii) from the right router to F. Also give the source and destination IP addresses in the IP datagram encapsulated within the frame at each of these points in time.
```
1. A to Router 1-1
Source MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:05
Dest. MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:00
Source IP: 192.168.1.3
Dest. IP: 192.168.1.1

2. Router 1-2 to Router 2-2
Source MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:02
Dest. MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:04
Source IP: 192.168.2.1
Dest. IP: 192.168.2.2

3. Router 2-1 to F
Source MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:03
Dest. MAC: 00:00:00:00:00:0A
Source IP: 192.168.3.1
Dest. IP: 192.168.3.4
```
